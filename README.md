# DS315 Covid Project ðŸ˜·
### The purpose of this project is to apply statistical analysis and machine learning techniques on recent 2019 health data from IPUMS using R Studio to investigate whether or not COVID-19 has had significant impact on patients receiving required healthcare.

Found above is a 'Final-Project-Code.docx' file which can be run after pasting the code in R Studio along with the appropriate dataset.

The project goals are as follows:
* Reorganize raw data into proper categorical classes and quantitative variables
* Remove unimportant predictor variables
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Train a variety of models including: Decision Forest, Boosting, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression
* Analyze final model graphs and interpret the results

The paper is coded in LaTeX, the final version of the paper is located at 'Project Paper.pdf'.
